# Driver Seat-Belt Detection Using CNN-SVM Hybrid Approach

This project focuses on developing an efficient system to detect if a driver is wearing a seat belt using a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The proposed model analyzes images to determine if a seat belt is buckled, leveraging the feature extraction capabilities of CNN and the classification strength of SVM.
